# giphyTrends

Technical brief :
You will use the Giphy API to fetch the last 20 trending gifs :
https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI

You can use the public beta key (only in debug environment). The client does not have the production key yet (you can keep the field empty in your configuration and add a TODO to remind you to add it later).
In the API response, do not parse fields you donâ€™t need to use to make the feature the client want.

GIFs must be displayed in a 2 columns grid with square format.
